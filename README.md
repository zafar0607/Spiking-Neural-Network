# Spiking-Neural-Network
Bio-Inspired Audio Codec Using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)

Overview

This project focuses on developing a bio-inspired audio codec using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The objective is to reconstruct stereo audio signals from spike data generated by an SNN and evaluate the quality of these reconstructions.

Features
Data Processing: Load raw audio data, timestamps, and sampling rates from files.
Signal Reconstruction: Use linear interpolation to reconstruct audio signals from spike data.
Visualization: Plot original and reconstructed audio signals for quality assessment.
Analysis: Compute metrics such as amplitude characteristics, spike counts, and distances between spike trains (e.g., Purpura distance and Rossum metric).
Neural Simulation: Simulate neuron spiking behavior using the NEST simulator with customizable parameters.
Encoding and Decoding: Encode audio data into spike currents and reconstruct values from spike data.
Spiking Neural Network Simulation: Encode sound amplitudes into spike currents, simulate an SNN, and analyze spike data.

Installation:

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Required Python libraries:
numpy
matplotlib
pydub
scipy
nest
h5py
Install dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib pydub scipy nest h5py

Usage:

Data Preparation
Convert MP3 files to WAV format.
Extract audio information such as sampling rate and amplitude range.
Save processed data and sampling rates into .npy files for further analysis.
Signal Reconstruction
Run the reconstruction script to generate stereo audio signals:

python reconstruct_audio.py
This script aligns timestamps, normalizes data, and interpolates spikes to reconstruct the audio signal.

Neuron Simulation
Simulate spiking behavior of neurons under varying input currents:

python simulate_neuron.py

Spiking Neural Network Simulation
Simulate an SNN using chunked audio data:
python simulate_snn.py
Results, including spike times and neuron IDs, are saved in .npy and .h5 formats.

Results:

Plots: Visual comparisons between original and reconstructed signals.
Audio Files: Saved reconstructed audio in WAV format.
Analysis Reports: Key metrics, including spike counts and amplitude characteristics.
Customization

Modify neuron parameters (e.g., C_m, tau_m, V_th) in the scripts to experiment with different configurations.
Adjust chunk size and simulation duration for finer control of the SNN simulation.
Example Outputs

Signal Reconstruction
Original vs. Reconstructed Audio Signals: Plotted waveform comparisons.
Spike Metrics: Calculated distances and spike counts.
Spiking Neural Network Simulation
Spike Data: Save senders and timestamps for detailed analysis.
